/*Given an array of integers arr[]. You have to find the Inversion Count of the array. 
Note : Inversion count is the number of pairs of elements (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j].

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The sequence 2, 4, 1, 3, 5 has three inversions (2, 1), (4, 1), (4, 3).
Input: arr[] = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Output: 0
Explanation: As the sequence is already sorted so there is no inversion count.
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: 0
Explanation: As all the elements of array are same, so there is no inversion count.
Constraints:
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105
1 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 104*/
