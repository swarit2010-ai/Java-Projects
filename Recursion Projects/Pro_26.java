/* You are given n disks placed on a starting rod (from), with the smallest disk on top and the largest at the bottom. There are three rods: the starting rod(from), the target rod (to), and an auxiliary rod (aux).
You have to calculate the minimum number of moves required to transfer all n disks from the starting rod to the target rod, following these rules:
1. Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2. A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty rod.
Return the minimum number of moves needed to complete the task.

Examples:

Input: n = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: For n = 2, total 3 steps will be taken. Steps are as follows -
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 3
Input: n = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: For n = 3, total 7 steps will be taken.Steps are as follows -
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 2 from rod 1 to rod 2
move disk 1 from rod 3 to rod 2
move disk 3 from rod 1 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 2 to rod 1
move disk 2 from rod 2 to rod 3
move disk 1 from rod 1 to rod 3
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
Explanation: Total 0 steps will be taken.
Constraints:
0 ≤ n ≤ 20*/
